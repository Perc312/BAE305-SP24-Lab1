# Summary
The goal of this lab was to familiarize students with the equipment we will be commonly using throughout the lab. Another purpose for this lab was to educate us on the limitations of the tools that we will be working with. This was done by comparing ideal and actual measurements along with the comparison of measurements taken for the same thing for several devices. The outcome of this lab was that we were able to see the shortcomings of the tools we will be working with for the rest of the semester. I also feel "warmed up" to the materials we will be using in lab.

# Test Equipment
 - Function generator
 - Oscope
 - DMM
 - Power source
 - Various resistors and capacitors

# Test Procedures
**Part 1** - Comparison of ideal vs. actual resistance using DMM
1. Determine and record the ideal resistance of the resistors given
2. Using the ideal resistance find the tolerance
3. Measure and record the actual resistance 
4. Check to see if actual resistances fall within the found tolerence
5. Repeat for each resistor

**Part 2** - Comparison of ideal vs. actual capacitance using DMM
1. Determine and record the ideal capacitance of the capacitors given
2. Using the ideal capacitance find the tolerance
3. Measure and record the actual capacitance 
4. Check to see if actual capacitances fall within the found tolerence
5. Repeat for each capacitor

**Part 3** - Comparison of power source ideal voltage vs. actual voltage
1. Set power source to required voltage(s)
2. Measure, record and compare ideal output voltage and actual output voltage
3. Repeat for each required voltage

**Part 4** - Comparing measured amplitude and frequency through different methods
1. Set the function generator to its maximum amplitude and a frequency of 2kHz
2. Connect the Oscope and adjust the parameters to observe the produced voltage
3. Using the Oscope, first measure the sine wave by counting the squares on the screen and using the metric they are measuring
4. Again using the Oscope, use the cursor function to measure period and amplitude
5. Again using the Oscope, utilize the measurement function to find period and amplitude
6. Finally, switch to the DMM and measure the voltage, as well as the frequency
7. Compare results from each measurement method

# Discussion
**Discussion Question 1** - Did the power source and measured voltage agree?

**Discussion Question 2** - Do the methods for measuring amplitude and frequency agree?
